At Johnson and Wales, Discrete Mathematics (M3020) is taken by two primary student populations: (1) Graphic design majors and (2) Networking or electronics engineering majors.  Both of these populations are required to take the course, and both are underprepared for the level of material in the course outline, though they are underprepared in different ways.


The graphics majors suffer from expected difficulties due to the level of their previous math experience and lack of "automaticity" to algebraic concepts and procedures.  The "tech" majors are stronger in their algebra background, and some of them have already learned some of the most applicable portions of the course through other experiences, but they are unfamiliar with the kind of mathematical thinking expected in a Discrete Math course.  They are used to procedural instruction and to following directions, and they are just as handicapped as the graphics majors in dealing with new contexts or with "exploration".


I see the course as an opportunity to model and to teach a "mathematican's mindset" to a student population that would otherwise *never* experience the creativity, beauty, and  depth of "real" mathematical thinking.  Both populations would be well served by such an experience, both in terms of future usage of specific applications of discrete mathematics, and in the use of mathematical thinking like exploration, formation of conjectures, rigorous testing and proof/disproof.
